// VKey - RCU config snapshot (Phase 3a — config reload out of keydown)
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only
//
// Phase 3 of the 2026-05-19 architecture review design
// (docs/plans/2026-05-19-architecture-review-design.md §Phase 3).
//
// Bundles every "variable-size config field" that today lives as a
// separately-owned `unordered_map` / `unordered_set` member of HookEngine
// (excludedAppSet_, tsfAppSet_, macroTable_, spaceMacroKeys_,
// appEncodingOverrides_, appInputMethodOverrides_) into a single
// immutable struct, published via `atomic<shared_ptr<const T>>` — the
// same RCU pattern HookEngine already uses for `config_` and `hotkeys_`.
//
// Why this exists (Rule 11.3 + Rule 11.2):
//   - Pre-Phase-3, `ReloadFromToml` ran on hook thread when triggered from
//     `QuickSyncFromSharedState` slow path inside `ProcessKeyDown` — that's
//     1-10ms of TOML parsing on the LL callback thread, exactly the
//     pattern Rule 11.2 forbids.
//   - Phase 3 moves the parse onto the worker thread and lets it publish
//     a fresh `shared_ptr<const ConfigSnapshot>`. The hook thread just
//     does an atomic load once per call — no syscalls, no allocations,
//     no contention with main.
//
// Phase 3a ships THIS header + the atomic field on HookEngine dormant —
// no producer yet, no readers migrated. Phase 3b adds the worker-side
// builder; Phase 3c migrates the readers; Phase 3d removes the legacy
// fields.
//
// Linux-portable: no Win32 dependencies. The tests in
// `tests/ConfigSnapshotTest.cpp` exercise the RCU semantics on Linux.
